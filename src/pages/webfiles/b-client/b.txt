BHP RESULTS FOR THE HALF YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2022
Note: All results presented in the News Release are on a continuing operations basis, except as noted.
Safety and sustainability: Unwavering focus on making our operations safe, sustainable and inclusive
 A colleague tragically lost his life in a rail incident at our Port Hedland operation in February 2023. We remain
resolute in our commitment to making BHP safe.
 Females now represent 33.6% of our workforce, a near doubling since we announced our aspirational goal for
gender balance in 2016.
 We continue to make good progress against our Social Value Framework, creating value for our people, partners,
the economy, the environment and local communities.
Operational excellence: Reliable operational performance and disciplined cost control
 Strong supply chain performance at Western Australia Iron Ore (WAIO) underpinned record half year production
and our continued leading C1 unit cost position of US$15.50 per tonne.
 Profit from operations of US$10.8 billion, down 27%, driven by a US$4.8 billion reduction in revenue which largely
reflects lower iron ore and copper prices. Underlying EBITDAi of US$13.2 billion at a margini of 54%.
 Attributable profit from total operations of US$6.5 billion and Underlying attributable profiti of US$6.6 billion, each
down 32% from the prior period.
 Net operating cash flow of US$6.8 billion and free cash flowi of US$3.5 billion.
 We paid US$7.5 billion in tax and royalty payments to governments in the December 2022 half year.
Disciplined capital allocation: Strong balance sheet enables our strategy
 Capital and exploration expenditurei of US$3.0 billion. Guidance for the full year of US$7.6 billion remains
unchanged.
 The Jansen Stage 1 project is tracking to plan, with targeted first production brought forward to 2026, from 2027.
We have commenced a feasibility study for Jansen Stage 2, which we expect to be completed during the 2024
financial year.
 We continued to expand our opportunities in future facing commodities through additional drilling at Oak Dam,
adding to our portfolio of early-stage entry investments, and the launch of BHP Xplor.
 In December 2022, we entered into a Scheme Implementation Deed with OZ Minerals Ltd (OZL) to acquire 100%
of OZL by way of a scheme arrangement for a cash price of A$28.25 per OZL share, which corresponds to an
enterprise value of A$9.8 billionii
.
 Our commitment to a strong balance sheet through the commodity price cycle remains, with net debti at
31 December 2022 of US$6.9 billion, towards the bottom of our target range of between US$5 and US$15 billion.
Value and returns: Interim dividend of 90 US cps and Underlying ROCEi of 29.4%
 The Board has determined to pay an interim dividend of 90 US cents per share (or US$4.6 billion), equivalent to a
69% payout ratio.

BHP Chief Executive Officer, Mike Henry:
“Jody Byrne, a rail yard technician in our team at Port Hedland in Western Australia, was fatally injured in a shunting
incident on Tuesday, 7 February. Jody was a respected and valued member of our company since 2013. Our deepest
sympathies and thoughts are with his family, friends and colleagues, and we are supporting them in any way we can at
this difficult time. Investigations into the incident are underway, and we will act on the findings.
“BHP has today announced a strong first half dividend of 90 US cents per share, on the back of solid operating
performance. During the half, we delivered well on the production front, with Western Australia Iron Ore posting another
record half. BHP remains the lowest cost major iron ore producer globally. We continued to make strong progress on
executing our strategy, including the development of growth options.
“Significant wet weather in our coal assets impacted production and unit costs, as did challenges in securing sufficient
labour. Inventory movements during the half contributed to costs, including the planned draw-down at Olympic Dam
after inventory built up during the smelter refurbishment last year. We expect these factors to abate in the second half
and for unit costs to fall, in line with revised guidance.
“Jansen Stage 1 in Canada is on track for first potash production in late calendar year 2026, and we have accelerated
Stage 2 studies. In Western Australia, we are progressing studies to develop options to lift iron ore production to 330
million tonnes per year, supported by our industry leading cost position.
“We are seeing ongoing positive exploration results from Oak Dam, which provides growth potential for our copper
business in South Australia. Our offer for OZ Minerals received unanimous support from their Board ahead of
consideration by their shareholders. In Queensland, together with our joint venture partner, Mitsubishi Development Pty
Ltd, we have initiated a process to divest the Daunia and Blackwater mines.
“We are positive about the demand outlook in the second half of FY23 and into FY24, with strengthening activity in
China on the back of recent policy decisions the major driver. We expect domestic demand in China and India to provide
stabilising counterweights to the ongoing slowdown in global trade and in the economies of the US, Japan and Europe.
The long-term outlook for our commodities remains strong given population growth, rising living standards and the
metals intensity of the energy transition, including for steel making raw materials.”

Health and safety
The safety, health and wellbeing of our workforce and the communities in which we operate is our highest priority.
Tragically, on 7 February 2023, one of our colleagues was fatally injured in an incident at our rail yard in Port Hedland,
Western Australia. A full investigation is underway to understand what happened and the circumstances that led to this
fatality.
Our strong focus on safety and health includes our commitment towards the elimination of sexual harassment, racism
and bullying in our workplaces and our accommodation villages. There is no place for these behaviours in society or at
BHP. We are continuing to build awareness, understanding, and capability across our workforce, enhancing prevention
controls globally, and strengthening how we respond and support impacted persons when these incidents occur. Over
the last 12 months, this focus has included holding global safety stops, with leaders directly engaging with all our teams
in all locations about sexual harassment, racism and bullying, as well as progressively deploying active bystander
training, which seeks to empower everyone to speak up against disrespectful or harmful behaviours. In parallel, we are
also taking further steps to encourage reporting of sexual harassment, and ensure our workforce feel safe to do so. We
continue to engage with external experts and our workforce to learn from best practice and enhance our approach.

Creating social value
By prioritising both financial and social value, we can create mutual benefits for our stakeholders and deliver long-term
value for our shareholders. Social value is our positive contribution to society – our people, partners, the economy, the
environment and local communities – anchored in enduring, mutually beneficial and trusting relationships.
In June 2022, we launched our social value scorecard with 2030 goals, metrics and milestones. Below is an indication
of progress over the past six months.
Key milestones and achievements
 Baseline mapping of Important Biodiversity and Ecosystems (IBEs) in the Minerals Australia region is complete, and
on track to complete in the Minerals Americas region by the end of the 2023 financial year. This will be used to
identify priority areas for action to meet our 2030 goal of creating nature-positiveiv outcomes by having at least 30
per cent of the land and water we steward under conservation, restoration or regenerative practices.
 In November 2022, we released our updated Indigenous Peoples Policy Statement. The revised global policy
statement outlines our commitment to working with Indigenous Peoples to support reconciliation and contribute to
improved social, economic and environmental outcomes.
 Context Based Water Targets (CBWTs) are intended to contribute to more effectively addressing the shared water
challenges in our operating regions and are informed by our catchment knowledge and our Water Resource
Situational Analyses. Development of the CBWTs is on track and we intend to publish them prior to the end of the
2023 financial year.

2 All data points are presented on a total operations basis, unless otherwise noted, and are indicative and subject to non-financial assurance
reviews. FY22 data for social investment and workforce participation includes the operated assets in our Petroleum business up to the date of
the merger (1 June 2022) and BMC up to the date of completion of the sale (3 May 2022).
3 For our baseline year of FY20, our operational GHG emissions were 14.5 Mt CO2-e, adjusted for discontinued operations (US Onshore and
Petroleum) and the divestment of BMC, and for methodological changes (use of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Assessment
Report 5 Global Warming Potentials and move to a facility-specific emissions calculation methodology for fugitives at Caval Ridge). These
adjustments have also been applied to the GHG emissions stated in this table to aid comparability. The use of carbon offsets will be governed
by BHP’s approach to carbon offsetting described at bhp.com/climate.
4 Prior to FY23, our voluntary social investment has been calculated as 1 per cent of the average of the previous three years’ pre-tax profit. For
FY23 – FY30, our social investment will be assessed as a total over the seven-year goals period to FY30, rather than calculated as an average
of the previous three years’ pre-tax profit.
5 We define gender balance as a minimum 40 per cent women and 40 per cent men in line with the definitions used by entities such as the
International Labour Organisation and HESTA.

Samarco
BHP Brasil remains committed to Samarco supporting the Renova Foundation and its work to progress the remediation
and compensatory programs to restore the environment and re-establish communities affected by the Samarco dam
failure, as set out in the Framework Agreement entered into in March 2016 by BHP Brasil, Samarco, Vale and relevant
Brazilian authorities.
In total, the Renova Foundation has spent R$28.1 billion (approximately US$5.9 billionv
) on remediation and
compensation programs to 31 December 2022, with compensation and financial assistance paid to approximately
410,000 people and approximately 70 per cent of resettlement cases completed.
The Group’s provisions related to the Samarco dam failure and Germano dam decommissioning totalled US$3.3 billion
as at 31 December 2022, with cost estimates for the Samarco dam failure provision unchanged from the June 2022
half. The expected cash outlay over the next 12 months in relation to these provisions is US$1.95 billion. In December
2022, BHP Brasil agreed to fund US$915 million in further financial support for the Renova Foundation. This funding is
for the 2023 calendar year and will be offset against the Group’s provision for the Samarco dam failure. Further funding
requirements for the period to 31 December 2023 continue to be assessed and will be subject to future approval by
BHP Brasil. Please see note 9 – ‘Significant events – Samarco dam failure’ for the Samarco dam failure provisions.
BHP Brasil, Samarco, Vale, Federal and State prosecutors and other public entities have been engaging in negotiations
to seek a definitive and substantive settlement of the obligations under the Framework Agreement and the R$155 billion
(approximately US$30 billionv
) claim. Outcomes of the negotiations are highly uncertain.
Samarco’s Judicial Reorganisation process is continuing in the Commercial Courts of Belo Horizonte, State of Minas
Gerais. The Judicial Reorganisation is a process for Samarco to restructure its financial debts in order to establish a
sustainable independent financial position that would allow Samarco to, among other things, continue its operations
safely and meet its Renova Foundation obligations. BHP Brasil will continue to support Samarco in this process.
Financial performance
Earnings and margins
 Attributable profit from total operations of US$6.5 billion includes an exceptional loss of US$0.1 billion (31 December
2021: US$9.4 billion, which included an exceptional loss of US$1.2 billion).
 The exceptional loss of US$0.1 billion (after tax) relates to the current half year impact of the Samarco dam failure
of US$140 million.
 Underlying attributable profit of US$6.6 billion (31 December 2021: US$9.7 billion) was underpinned by strong
operational and cost performance across our operations.
 Profit from operations of US$10.8 billion (31 December 2021: US$14.8 billion) decreased as a result of lower
realised prices for iron ore and copper, higher royalties as a result of the increased Queensland Government royalty
rates, and inflationary impacts across the group, partially offset by record production at WAIO, higher realised prices
for thermal coal and nickel, and favourable exchange rate movements.
 Underlying EBITDA of US$13.2 billion (31 December 2021: US$18.5 billion), with an EBITDA margin of 54 per cent
(31 December 2021: 64 per cent). Additional commentary is included on page 12.
 Underlying return on capital employed decreased to 29.4 per cent (31 December 2021: 39.5 per cent).
Costs
 We continue to see the lagged impact of inflationary pressures, in particular for diesel, with an effective inflation rate
of approximately 12 per cent. Across the Group, inventory movements were also a significant driver of higher unit
costsi during the period, as a result of both planned drawdowns of stockpiles and the consequences of labour
availability challenges and significant wet weather. Outside of these factors, our focus on cost discipline has allowed
us to effectively manage in the current environment.
 Unit costs at WAIO were above guidance at the half year (based on guidance exchange rates of AUD/USD 0.72)
primarily due to the drawdown of mine inventories as a result of labour availability, and the impact of inflation,
particularly for diesel.

 Escondida unit costs were at the top end of the guidance range at the half year (based on guidance exchange rates
of USD/CLP 830), reflecting volumes tracking to the low end of the production guidance range due to lower than
expected concentrator feed grade and throughput.
 BHP Mitsubishi Alliance (BMA) unit costs were above the revised guidance range at the half year (based on
guidance exchange rates of AUD/USD 0.72) primarily due to significant wet weather impacts on production during
the first half, inventory movements and inflationary pressures. A stronger second half performance is expected
following planned maintenance undertaken in the first half but remains subject to further potential wet weather
impacts.
 New South Wales Energy Coal (NSWEC) unit costs were above the revised guidance range at the half year (based
on guidance exchange rates of AUD/USD 0.72) primarily due to lower volumes as a result of record wet weather
and increased port costs driven by higher thermal coal prices and inflation.
 Full year unit cost guidance for WAIO and Escondida remains unchanged (based on guidance exchange rates of
AUD/USD 0.72 and USD/CLP 830) however are tracking towards the upper end of their guidance ranges. Unit cost
guidance for BMA and NSWEC has been increased, largely reflecting the production impacts of significant wet
weather and inflationary pressures.

unable to provide medium-term production guidance for BMA.
Cash flow and balance sheet
 Net operating cash flows of US$6.8 billion (31 December 2021: US$11.5 billion) reflects lower iron ore and copper
prices, partially offset by reliable operational performance and cost discipline during the period. This includes an
unfavourable working capital movement of US$1.2 billion largely related to royalty payables, net price impacts on
receivables and other movements. Income tax and royalty-related taxation payments of US$5.5vi billion include
approximately US$2.7 billion of tax instalments and final tax payments relating to the 2022 financial year, and which
reflected a higher price environment.
BHP Results for the half year ended 31 December 2022

 Free cash flow of US$3.5 billion for the half year, inclusive of capital and exploration expenditure of US$3.0 billion.
 Our balance sheet remains strong with net debt at US$6.9 billion at 31 December 2022 (30 June 2022: US$0.3
billion; 31 December 2021: US$6.1 billion), towards the bottom of our target range. The increase of US$6.6 billion
in net debt in the half year (or an increase of US$0.8 billion from 31 December 2021) reflects the final dividend paid
to shareholders in September 2022 of US$8.7 billion and dividends paid to non-controlling interests of US$0.5
billion, partially offset by the free cash flow generated by our operations.

million; FY22: $790 million).
 Average annual sustaining capital expenditure guidance over the medium term, excluding costs associated with
greenhouse gas emissions abatement and our automation programs, for WAIO remains unchanged at
approximately US$5 per tonneviii
.
 As a result of the Queensland Government’s decision to raise coal royalties to the highest maximum rate in the
world, the fiscal environment is no longer competitive or predictable and as such BMA is not making significant new
investments in Queensland and is not providing annual sustaining capital expenditure guidance at this time.
 Capital expenditure on operational decarbonisation is expected to be around US$4 billion in aggregate up to the
2030 financial year and is assessed through the capital allocation framework to ensure alignment with our FY30
and 2050 operational emissions reduction target and goal and maximise shareholder value.

Projects
 At the end of the December 2022 half year, the Jansen Stage 1 project was tracking to plan. During the half, we
brought forward the target for first production from 2027 to the end of the 2026 calendar year. Capital expenditure
for the December 2022 half year was US$364 million, largely for surface and civil works and acceleration of
procurement contracts.
 Expected Jansen Stage 1 capital expenditure for the 2023 financial year has increased to approximately US$860
million, from approximately US$740 million, partly due to an accelerated production schedule. There is no change
to the project’s total capital expenditure budget of US$5.7 billion (C$7.5 billion). Work in the 2023 financial year will
continue to focus on civil and mechanical construction on the surface and underground, as well as equipment
procurement and port construction. We have awarded US$2.5 billion in contracts, covering the port, underground,
mining systems and other construction activities.
 In addition, we have accelerated the feasibility study for Jansen Stage 2, to be completed during the 2024 financial
year, a year earlier than previously expected.

 We continue to progress with the implementation of autonomous trucks across our operations.
– At the Goonyella Riverside and Daunia coal mines in Queensland, all BMA operated haul trucks are now
autonomous.
– At South Flank in Western Australia, the project to automate the current fleet of 41 Komatsu haul trucks
commenced in the June 2022 quarter and is expected to be completed by the end of the 2023 calendar year.
Studies are underway for deployment at Newman West and Mining Area C.
– After the successful implementation of autonomous drills at both Escondida and Spence, the deployment of
autonomous trucks has commenced with four trucks at Spence and is planned to expand to 33 trucks. At
Escondida, autonomous trucks are scheduled to commence deployment during the 2024 financial year.
Operations Services
Operations Services (OS) performs business critical services across our operations in Australia, including maintaining
a significant portion of ultra-class trucks and moving significant volumes of material as part of production services. At
31 December 2022, OS was responsible for maintaining 43 per cent of BHP's haul trucks across Minerals Australia,
including 95 per cent of ultra-class trucks at BMA, and the 308 km of conveyors in our WAIO operations.
The BHP FutureFit Academy, launched in May 2020, has welcomed over 600 students and graduated over 300
apprentices and maintenance associates during this period at its facilities in Perth in Western Australia and Mackay in
Queensland. Of the graduates, 85 per cent are female, 23 per cent identify as Indigenous and the majority are new to
industry.

Outlook

Economic outlook
Population growth, rising living standards, and the infrastructure required for decarbonisation are all expected to drive
demand for steel, non-ferrous metals and fertilisers for decades to come.
In the near term, BHP’s operating environment is expected to remain volatile. Growth momentum is expected to slow
substantially across the developed world as the impact of anti-inflationary policies progressively bites. On the other
hand, after a difficult time in the first half of the 2023 financial year, China appears set to serve as a source of stability
for commodity demand, with major headwinds in the process of being removed and tailwinds likely to progressively
emerge in their place.
Inflationary trends diverged over the last six months, as expected. Non-energy raw materials, logistics and
manufacturing supply chain pressures eased, while energy and labour cost concerns were consistently elevated. The
lag effect of inflation and continued labour market tightness are expected to impact our cost base into the 2024 financial
year. Exchange rates have adjusted rapidly against the evolving macroeconomic backdrop, with US dollar strength
having provided a partial offset for local currency cost inflation in our major operating jurisdictions.
Overall, and despite the easing inflationary pulse across many cost categories, the marginal cost of mining production
is now estimated to be markedly higher than it was prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. This implies that price support is
also expected to be higher than in previous cycles and low-cost operators stand to capture higher relative margins in
certain commodities.
Commodities review and outlook
Global steel production was mixed in the first half of the 2023 financial year, with unconvincing growth in China, solid
conditions in India and outright declines across developed regions, led by Europe and the conflict-constrained
Commonwealth of Independent States. Steelmakers across all regions saw their margins squeezed, with lower sale
prices intersecting with high input costs. Ex-China steel markets are expected to remain under pressure as the general
industrial climate softens. India, in the lead-up to next year’s general election, may prove to be an exception. While
improved end-use demand conditions are anticipated in China, the extent to which that will flow through to improved
profitability for mills (thereby influencing raw materials quality differentials) is uncertain.
The iron ore market spent much of the first half of the 2023 financial year at or slightly above real-time cost support in
the US$80-US$100/t CFR range. The price moved above that range late in the period, on the expectation that demand
conditions would firm in China on the back of pro-growth policies. Chinese port stocks are roughly 25 Mt lower than they
were a year ago, with both low and high-cost seaborne supply having underperformed (in aggregate) across the 2022
calendar year. In the medium term, China’s demand for iron ore is expected to be lower than it is today as crude steel
production plateaus and the scrap-to-steel ratio rises. In the long term, prices are expected to be determined by highcost production, on a value-in-use adjusted basis, from Australia or Brazil. It is imperative that we continue to compete
on both product quality and as a low-cost producer.
Metallurgical coal prices were less volatile in the first half of the 2023 financial year than in the prior half, as the
seaborne trade progressively adjusted to the shock of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. On the demand side, ex-China
pig iron production was weak, driven by output cuts in Europe and Northeast Asia. Conditions remained tight on the
supply side; adverse weather conditions in Australia and Canada and the diversion of some metallurgical coal to power
generation under record high energy coal pricing offered some support to the market. Longer term, we believe that
higher quality metallurgical coals will continue to be required in blast furnace steel making for decades, driven by the
growth of the steel industry in hard coking coal importing countries such as India. Premium Hard Coking Coals are
expected to be valued for their role in reducing the greenhouse gas emissions intensity of blast furnaces. With the major
seaborne supply region of Queensland having become less conducive to long-life capital investment as a result of
changes to the royalty regime, the scarcity value of such coals may well increase over time. China’s import policy
remains a source of uncertainty.
Copper prices fell sharply late in the second half of the 2022 financial year as demand risks in the developed world
mounted. Prices then traded in a well-defined range for much of the first half of the 2023 financial year, with $7,000/t
being the approximate floor. Low visible inventories and below-average industry-wide supply performance prevented
prices from falling further. Global demand growth is expected to be modest in aggregate, with improvement in China
offsetting weakness in the OECD. Notwithstanding the fact that revisions to industry production guidance have generally
been to the downside of late, we expect modest near-term demand to be well covered by a combination of rising primary
and scrap supply. Longer term, traditional end-use demand is expected to be solid and the electrification mega-trend
News release
10
offers attractive upside. In terms of meeting that demand, we anticipate that the cost curve is likely to steepen as
geological inflation, social value expectations, above ground risks, decarbonisation and water challenges are
progressively heightened.
Nickel prices have been volatile over the first half of the 2023 financial year, although not to the same extent as in the
immediate aftermath of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Tight fundamentals in the Class-1 segment remain in place,
exemplified by the persistence of very low exchange inventories. Offsetting that, demand risks have weighed heavily on
investor sentiment. Meanwhile, other classes of nickel supply have been ramping up quickly in Indonesia, which has
resulted in large spreads between Class-1 nickel priced on the LME and other nickel products and intermediates priced
in China, where surpluses have been evident. Longer term, we believe nickel will be a core beneficiary of the
electrification mega-trend and that nickel sulphides will be particularly attractive.
Potash prices have declined steadily throughout the first half of the 2023 financial year as affordability deteriorated,
unwinding the steep price spike that developed in the wake of Belarusian sanctions and the invasion of Ukraine. Longer
term, potash stands to benefit from the intersection of global megatrends: rising population, changing diets and the need
for the sustainable intensification of agriculture on finite arable land. The compelling demand picture, geopolitical
uncertainty and the maturity of the existing asset base offers an attractive entry opportunity in a lower-risk supply
jurisdiction such as Saskatchewan, Canada.
Portfolio
The commodities we produce are essential for global economic growth and the world’s ability to transition to and thrive
in a low carbon future. Our existing portfolio is built upon an industry leading set of large, low cost and expandable
resource bases, which generates attractive and consistent returns.
We have simplified and strengthened our portfolio in recent years. However, as the world continues to evolve towards
a lower carbon future, we must actively manage our portfolio to mitigate the risks that a changing world presents and to
take advantage of opportunities to grow value.
Given our strategy to focus our coal portfolio on the highest quality metallurgical coals, BHP and Mitsubishi Development
Pty Ltd, 50:50 joint venture partners in BMA, have started to pursue options to divest the Daunia and Blackwater mines
following detailed considerations of BMA’s longer-term plans. Whilst high quality assets with growth potential, the Daunia
and Blackwater mines would struggle to compete for capital under our capital allocation framework, including given our
choices for deploying capital globally, and we are seeking to divest these assets to an operator who is more likely to
prioritise the necessary investments for continued successful operation. We will look to maximise the value of these
assets via trade sale.
In June 2022, BHP announced its decision to retain NSWEC in our portfolio, seek the relevant approvals to continue
mining beyond its current mining consent that expires in 2026 and proceed with a managed process to cease mining at
the asset by the end of the 2030 financial year. The 2030 consent modification approval process is progressing, and
includes preparation of relevant studies and documentation, as well as ongoing engagement with key regulatory
authorities and community stakeholders. The consent modification we are seeking is to allow time for stakeholder
consultation for a just transition and is expected to carry conditions which prevent new infrastructure or production
growth. As a result, over the period to 2030, we will not be allocating any growth capital to NSWEC and production is
expected to remain broadly in line with current levels of 13 to 15 Mtpa. In light of the NSW Government announcement
on potential changes to its coal price cap and domestic reservation requirements, we are actively reviewing operational
plans, existing commitments and logistical practicalities to understand their implications. Further, it is important to note
that NSWEC’s current unit cost of production is above the NSW Governments’ proposed price cap of A$125 per tonne.
In December 2022, BHP announced the signing of a Scheme Implementation Deed (SID) with OZ Minerals Ltd (OZL)
to acquire 100 per cent of OZL through a scheme of arrangement for a cash price of A$28.25 per OZL share less the
amount of any dividends declared and paid by OZL prior to implementation (Scheme). This corresponds to an enterprise
value of A$9.8 billionii for OZL. The SID confirms the terms of the Scheme and BHP’s non-binding indicative proposal
announced on 18 November 2022. The implementation of the Scheme is subject to satisfaction of certain conditions
including OZL shareholder and Australian court approval and receipt of approvals from regulators in relevant jurisdictions
(including Brazil, now received, and Vietnam). The OZL Board has unanimously recommended that OZL shareholders
vote in favour of the Scheme in the absence of a superior proposal and subject to an independent expert concluding
that the Scheme is in the best interests of OZL shareholders.

Underlying EBITDA
The following table and commentary describe the impact of the principal factorsi
that affected Underlying EBITDA for
the December 2022 half year compared with the December 2021 half year:
US$M
Half year ended 31 December 2021 18,463
Net price impact:
Change in sales prices (3,549) Lower average realised prices for iron ore, copper, and hard coking coal, partially
offset by higher average realised prices for weak coking coal, thermal coal and
nickel.
Price-linked costs (333) Net increase in royalties reflecting impacts of the increased Queensland Government
royalty rates and higher realised prices for thermal coal partially offset by lower
royalties for iron ore as a result of lower realised prices, combined with higher third
party concentrate purchase costs due to higher nickel prices.
(3,882)
Change in volumes 704 Increased volumes at: Olympic Dam as a result of strong concentrator and smelter
performance, and the planned major smelter maintenance campaign (SCM21) in the
prior period; Escondida due to higher concentrator feed grade; WAIO record half year
production as a result of continued strong supply chain performance and increased
lump sales driven by the continued ramp up of South Flank; and BMA driven by
improved truck productivity, partially offset by the deferral of concentrate sales at
Spence following a fire at Port Mejillones and decreased volumes at NSWEC as a
result of record rainfall.
Change in controllable cash costs (517) Largely due to the unfavourable impacts of inventory movements: at WAIO, to
support supply chain performance amidst lower labour availability (US$241 million);
and at Olympic Dam, following a stock build during SCM21 in the prior period
(US$165 million). Higher one-off contractor costs and higher consumable costs at
Escondida and Spence. Higher costs at BMA resulted from the production impacts of
significant wet weather.
Change in other costs:
Exchange rates 394 Impact of movements in the Australian dollar and Chilean peso against the US dollar.
Inflation (663) Impact of significant increases in global inflation rates on the Group's cost base.
Fuel, energy, and consumable price movements (383) Predominantly higher diesel and explosives prices.
Non-cash (17)
(669)
Asset sales 6
Ceased and sold operations (470) Predominantly the contribution of BMC prior to divestment of our 80% interest on 3
May 2022.
Other items (405) Other includes the recovery of lower freight costs caused by movements in the freight
index on consecutive voyage charter (CVC) voyages and lower profit at Antamina
largely driven by lower realised copper prices.

The Group’s adjusted effective tax rate, which excludes the impact of exchange rate movements and exceptional items,
was 29.5 per cent (31 December 2021: 30.2 per cent). The adjusted effective tax rate was lower than at 31 December
2021 primarily due to lower withholding taxes and lower overall Chilean mining tax reflecting lower operating margins.
The adjusted effective tax rate for the 2023 financial year is expected to be in the range of 30 to 35 per cent.
Royalty arrangements which are not profit based are recognised as operating costs within Profit before taxation. These
increased to US$1.8 billion during the period (31 December 2021: US$1.7 billion), despite a lower price environment,
largely reflecting the increase in Queensland Government royalty rates from 1 July 2022.

Debt management and liquidity
During the December 2022 half year, gross debt decreased by US$1.7 billion to US$14.7 billion at 31 December 2022.
This decrease includes a EUR0.4 billion repayment of 0.75 per cent EUR senior notes that matured on 28 October 2022
and a GBP0.6 billion repayment of 6.50 per cent GBP hybrid security notes that were called with an early redemption
date on 22 October 2022. The reduction also includes US$0.7 billion of foreign exchange and interest rate adjustments.
At the subsidiary level, Escondida refinanced US$0.3 billion of long-term debt that was due to mature in the period and
increased the term loan facility to US$0.5 billion, of which $0.1 billion remains undrawn as at 31 December 2022.
BHP continues to hold a robust liquidity position with US$9.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents. The Group also has
a US$5.5 billion commercial paper program backed by a US$5.5 billion revolving credit facility. As at 31 December
2022, the Group had no outstanding commercial paper and no drawn amount under the revolving credit facility.
In February 2023, BHP entered into a fully underwritten US$5.0 billion new loan facility, which is available to be drawn
down to support the potential acquisition of OZ Minerals.

Underlying EBITDA for the December 2022 half year decreased by US$1.5 billion to US$2.8 billion.
US$M
Underlying EBITDA for the half year ended
31 December 2021
4,272
Net price impact:
Change in sales prices (1,275) Lower average realised price:
Copper US$3.49/lb (H1 FY22: US$4.31/lb).
Price-linked costs 9
Change in volumes 639 Higher volumes at Escondida due to higher concentrator feed grade (H1 FY23:
0.79%, H1 FY22: 0.72%), partly offset by lower concentrator throughput and the
impact of road blockades across Chile, which reduced availability of some key mine
supplies. At Spence, despite higher production due to the improved operational
performance at the Spence Growth Option (SGO), concentrate sales volumes were
lower due to a fire at the non-operated Port Mejillones in October 2022, which
resulted in the deferral of some shipments into the June 2023 half year. Higher
volumes at Olympic Dam as a result of strong concentrator and smelter performance,
and the planned major smelter maintenance campaign (SCM21) in the prior period.
Change in controllable cash costs (292) At Olympic Dam, higher costs largely reflected impacts of an inventory drawdown
following a stock build during SCM21 in the prior period. Higher costs at Escondida
and Spence primarily reflected one-off contractor costs and higher consumables
costs. Costs at Cerro Colorado increased as ore inventories were utilised ahead of
planned closure at the end of the 2023 calendar year.
Change in other costs:
Exchange rates 45
Inflation (305)
Fuel, energy, and consumable price movement (92) Higher diesel, explosives and acid prices, partially offset by lower power prices at
Escondida due to the transition to renewable energy.
Non-cash 11
Other items (198) Other includes lower profit at Antamina, largely driven by lower realised copper prices.
Underlying EBITDA for the half year ended
31 December 2022

Escondida unit costs increased by 12 per cent to US$1.44 per pound, at realised exchange rates. This reflects
inflationary pressures, in particular for diesel, acid and explosives. It also reflects lower by-product credits, as a result
of lower realised gold and silver prices. These increases were partially offset by an increase in volumes in the period
and lower power prices at Escondida due to the transition towards 100 per cent renewable energy.
For the 2023 financial year, unit costs at Escondida are tracking towards the upper end of full year guidance of between
US$1.25 and US$1.45 per pound (at a guidance exchange rate of USD/CLP 830). This is due to volumes tracking
towards the low end of Escondida’s production guidance range as a result of lower than expected concentrator feed
grade and throughput. In the medium term, we continue to expect unit costs to be less than US$1.15 per pound (based
on an exchange rate of USD/CLP 830).

At Spence, we continue to closely monitor previously identified Tailings Storage Facility (TSF) anomalies. We have
reduced the volume of water in the tailings facility and continue to work with the local regulatory agencies, including on
the implementation of a remediation plan for the TSF. The SGO concentrator continues to operate with no impact to
production or market guidance. Spence is expected to reach an average of approximately 270 ktpa of production for
four years (including cathodes) following the completion of the SGO plant modifications and remediation of TSF
anomalies. Expected capital expenditure for the SGO plant modifications works remains unchanged at approximately
US$100 million. Further studies are ongoing for additional capacity uplift at SGO. Cerro Colorado continues to transition
towards planned closure at the end of the 2023 calendar year.

WAIO unit costs increased by 13 per cent to US$18.30 per tonne at realised exchange rates (US$15.50 per tonne on a
C1 basis excluding third party royalties1
, an increase of five per cent), primarily due to the impact of inflation, particularly
for diesel, and the drawdown of mine inventories as a result of labour availability. This was partially offset by lower pricelinked third party royalties and favourable exchange rate movements.
Full year unit cost guidance for the 2023 financial year remains unchanged at between US$18 and US$19 per tonne
(based on an exchange rate of AUD/USD 0.72) and is tracking towards the upper end. In the medium term, we expect
to lower our unit costs to less than US$17 per tonne (based on an exchange rate of AUD/USD 0.72) reflecting ongoing
improvements across the supply chain.

NSWEC unit costs increased by 49 per cent to US$101 per tonne at realised exchange rates, primarily due to lower
volumes as a result of record wet weather and the focus on higher value coal products to capture the ~US$230 per
tonne price differential between higher and lower calorific coals (H1 FY22: ~US$70 per tonne), increased price-linked
port costs as a result of higher sales prices, and the impact of inflation, particularly for diesel. This was partially offset
by favourable inventory and exchange rate movements.
Unit cost guidance for the 2023 financial year has been increased to between US$84 and US$91 per tonne (based on

Greenfield exploration
BHP continued to strengthen its portfolio of options, including through an increased focus on exploration. Exploration
expenditure during the December 2022 half year increased by 42 per cent to US$156 million.
Work continues on existing exploration projects, joint ventures and farm-in agreements, as well as leveraging technology
to both look deeper in mature exploration jurisdictions and delineate new high potential search spaces globally.
We continue to progress exploration activity for copper in Australia, Canada, Chile, Ecuador, north-west Mexico, Peru
and the south-west United States and initiated greenfield activities in southern Colombia. Nickel programs were also
advanced in Canada and Australia.
At Oak Dam in South Australia, BHP is continuing resource definition drilling with six drill rigs to define the extent,
continuity and variability of the mineralisation. Between May 2021 and December 2022, we completed approximately
40 km of drilling, with high-grade mineralised intercepts of copper, and associated gold, uranium and silver. Results
continue to be encouraging, with multiple intervals ranging between 0.9 and 4.3 per cent copper identified by laboratory
assay results consistent with intercepts previously reported in the September 2020 Operational Review. Mineralisation
below cover remains open at the south and at depth. For further details refer to Appendix 1. Our forward plan is to
continue drilling and engage externally with key stakeholders including Traditional Owners, landholders, government
and the community, with a view to converting the exploration licence to a retention lease, which will allow BHP to carry
out further exploration activities.
Work continued on the farm-in agreement for the early-stage Elliott copper project in the Northern Territory, Australia,
Initial drilling has identified some favourable geological features, with a field mapping and sampling program planned
for the June 2023 quarter, following seasonal rains.
On 21 July 2022 we extended our strategic alliance with Midland Exploration to fund a new nickel exploration program
in Nunavick, Quebec.
In August 2022, we announced the establishment of BHP Xplor, an innovative accelerator program to support
early-stage mineral exploration companies to find critical resources for the energy transition, such as copper and nickel.
The program merges concepts from venture capital and early-stage accelerators offering participants in-kind services,
mentorship, and networking opportunities. Applications for the program closed on 31 October 2022 and we received a
significant number of applications from around the world. We have selected seven companies into the inaugural
accelerator program which began in January 2023 and is expected to run until the end of June 2023.
In October 2022, BHP agreed to invest an additional US$50 million (the second investment) in the Kabanga Nickel
Project (Kabanga) in Tanzania. Following closing of that investment in February 2023, BHP’s interest in Kabanga
increased to 14.3 per cent. In October 2022, BHP also signed an agreement with Kabanga Nickel Limited giving BHP
the option to increase its interest in Kabanga to 51 per cent.
Following a review of prospectivity and core results, BHP acquired a 19.9 per cent interest via a placement in Brixton
Metals, providing exposure to a large block of ground prospective for copper in northern British Columbia, Canada.
In January 2023, BHP signed an Option Agreement with Mundoro Capital, Inc. covering three exploration projects they
currently hold in Serbia (Trstenik, Borsko and South Timok). This agreement provides BHP with the option to secure up
to 100 per cent interest in the three copper exploration prospects over the next three years, depending on the exploration
results.
Group and unallocated items
Underlying EBITDA for Group and unallocated items decreased by US$252 million to US$144 million in the December
2022 half year, primarily due to the recovery of lower freight costs caused by movements in the freight index on
consecutive voyage charter (CVC) voyages of US$225 million.
Nickel West’s Underlying EBITDA decreased by US$19 million to US$99 million in the December 2022 half year. This
reflects unfavourable inventory movements, the adverse impacts of the higher nickel price on third party concentrate
purchase costs and the impact of inflation, particularly for diesel and ammonia. This was largely offset by higher prices
and favourable exchange rate movements.

Forward-looking statements
This release contains forward-looking statements, including statements regarding: trends in economic outlook; commodity prices and currency exchange rates; demand
for commodities; medium-term guidance; reserves and resources and production forecasts; operational performance; expectations, plans, strategies and objectives of
management; climate scenarios; approval of certain projects and consummation of certain transactions, including, but not limited to, our announced proposed of OZL;
closure or divestment of certain assets, operations or facilities (including associated costs); anticipated production or construction commencement dates; capital
expenditure or costs and scheduling; operating costs, including unit cost guidance, and shortages of materials and skilled employees; anticipated productive lives of
projects, mines and facilities; provisions and contingent liabilities; and tax and regulatory developments.
Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of terminology, including, but not limited to, ‘intend’, ‘aim’, ‘ambition’, ‘aspiration’, ‘goal’, ‘target’, ‘prospect’, ‘project’,
‘see’, ‘anticipate’, ‘estimate’, ‘plan’, ‘objective’, ‘believe’, ‘expect’, ‘commit’, ‘may’, ‘should’, ‘need’, ‘must’, ‘will’, ‘would’, ‘continue’, ‘forecast’, ‘guidance’, ‘outlook’, ‘trend’ or
similar words. These statements discuss future expectations concerning the results of assets or financial conditions, or provide other forward-looking information.
These forward-looking statements are based on management’s current expectations and reflect judgements, assumptions, estimates and other information available as at the
date of this release and/or the date of the Group’s planning processes or scenario analysis processes. These statements do not represent guarantees or predictions of future
financial or operational performance and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, and which may cause actual
results to differ materially from those expressed in the statements contained in this release. BHP cautions against reliance on any forward-looking statements or guidance,
including in light of the current economic climate and the significant volatility, uncertainty and disruption arising in connection with the Ukraine conflict and COVID-19.
For example, our future revenues from our assets, projects or mines described in this release will be based, in part, on the market price of the minerals or metals produced,
which may vary significantly from current levels. These variations, if materially adverse, may affect the timing or the feasibility of the development of a particular project,
the expansion of certain facilities or mines, or the continuation of existing assets.
Other factors that may affect the actual construction or production commencement dates, revenues, costs or production output and anticipated lives of assets, mines or
facilities include our ability to profitably produce and transport the minerals and/or metals extracted to applicable markets; the impact of foreign currency exchange rates
on the market prices of the minerals or metals we produce; activities of government authorities in the countries where we sell our products and in the countries where we
are exploring or developing projects, facilities or mines, including increases in taxes and royalties; changes in environmental and other regulations, the duration and severity
of the Ukraine conflict and the COVID-19 pandemic and their impact on our business; political or geopolitical uncertainty; labour unrest; weather, climate variability or other
manifestations of climate change; and other factors identified in the risk factors discussed in BHP’s filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the ‘SEC’)
(including in Annual Reports on Form 20-F) which are available on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov.
Except as required by applicable regulations or by law, BHP does not undertake to publicly update or review any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new
information or future events.
Past performance cannot be relied on as a guide to future performance.
No offer of securities
Nothing in this release should be construed as either an offer, or a solicitation of an offer, to buy or sell BHP securities in any jurisdiction, or be treated or relied upon as a
recommendation or advice by BHP.
Reliance on third party information
The views expressed in this release contain information that has been derived from publicly available sources that have not been independently verified. No representation
or warranty is made as to the accuracy, completeness or reliability of the information. This release should not be relied upon as a recommendation or forecast by BHP.
No financial or investment advice – South Africa
BHP does not provide any financial or investment 'advice' as that term is defined in the South African Financial Advisory and Intermediary Services Act, 37 of 2002, and
we strongly recommend that you seek professional advice.
Emissions and energy consumption data
Due to the inherent uncertainty and limitations in measuring greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and operational energy consumption under the calculation methodologies
used in the preparation of such data, all GHG emissions and operational energy consumption data or references to GHG emissions and operational energy consumption
volumes (including ratios or percentages) in this release are estimates. There may also be differences in the manner that third parties calculate or report GHG emissions
or operational energy consumption data compared to BHP, which means that third-party data may not be comparable to our data. For information on how we calculate our
GHG emissions and operational energy consumption data, see BHP Scopes 1, 2, and 3 GHG emissions calculation methodology available at bhp.com/climate.
BHP and its subsidiaries
In this release, the terms ‘BHP’, the ‘Company, the ‘Group’, ‘BHP Group’, ‘our business’, ‘organisation’, ‘we’, ‘us’, ‘our’ and ourselves’ refer to BHP Group Limited and,
except where the context otherwise requires, our subsidiaries. Refer to note 28 ‘Subsidiaries’ of the Financial Statements in the FY2022 Annual Report and Form 20-F for
a list of our significant subsidiaries. Those terms do not include non-operated assets.
This release covers functions and assets (including those under exploration, projects in development or execution phases, sites and closed operations) that have been
wholly owned and/or operated by BHP or that have been owned as a joint venture1 operated by BHP (referred to in this release as ‘operated assets’ or ‘operations’) during
the period from 1 July 2022 to 31 December 2022. BHP also holds interests in assets that are owned as a joint venture but not operated by BHP (referred to in this release
as ‘non-operated joint ventures’ or ‘non-operated assets’). Notwithstanding that this release may include production, financial and other information from non-operated
assets, non-operated assets are not included in the BHP Group and, as a result, statements regarding our operations, assets and values apply only to our operated assets
unless stated otherwise.
1 References in this release to a ‘joint venture’ are used for convenience to collectively describe assets that are not wholly owned by BHP. Such references are not intended
to characterise the legal relationship between the owners of the asset.

1 As a result of the corporate structure unification on 31 January 2022, 2,112,071,796 fully paid ordinary shares in BHP Group Limited were
issued to BHP Group Plc shareholders in a one for one exchange of their BHP Group Plc ordinary shares, resulting in BHP Group Limited
becoming the sole parent of the Group with a single set of shareholders. This resulted in an increase in BHP Group Limited share capital,
reduction of BHP Group Plc share capital to US$ nil and a reduction of the Group’s reserve balances.

Notes to the Financial Statements
1. Basis of preparation
This general purpose Financial Report for the half year ended 31 December 2022 is unaudited and has been prepared
in accordance with IAS 34 ‘Interim Financial Reporting’ as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board
(IASB) and AASB 134 ‘Interim Financial Reporting’ as issued by the Australian Accounting Standards Board (AASB)
and the Australian Corporations Act 2001 as applicable to interim financial reporting. The general purpose Financial
Report for the half year ended 31 December 2022 does not include all of the notes of the type normally included in an
annual report. Accordingly, this report should be read in conjunction with the annual consolidated Financial Statements
for the year ended 30 June 2022 and any public announcements made by the Group in accordance with the continuous
disclosure obligations of the ASX Listing Rules.
Segment Reporting disclosures from IAS 34/AASB 134 ‘Interim Financial Reporting’ have been disclosed within the
Segment summary on page 15 outside of this Financial Report.
The half year Financial Statements have been prepared on a basis of accounting policies and methods of computation
consistent with those applied in the 30 June 2022 annual consolidated Financial Statements contained within the Annual
Report of the Group with the exception of the adoption of an amendment to IAS 16/AASB 116 ‘Property, Plant and
Equipment’ which became effective from 1 July 2022. The impact of this amendment is described below. A number of
other accounting standards and interpretations have been issued, and will be applicable in future periods. While these
remain subject to ongoing assessment, no significant impacts have been identified to date. These standards have not
been applied in the preparation of these half year Financial Statements.
All amounts are expressed in US dollars unless otherwise stated. The Group’s presentation currency and the functional
currency of the majority of its operations is US dollars as this is the principal currency of the economic environment in
which it operates. Amounts in this Financial Report have, unless otherwise indicated, been rounded to the nearest
million dollars.
The Directors have made an assessment of the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern for the 12 months from
the date of this report and consider it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the half
year Financial Statements.
Impact of new and amended standards and interpretations
On 1 July 2022, the Group adopted an amendment to IAS 16/AASB 116 ‘Property, Plant and Equipment’ that requires
an entity to recognise the sales proceeds from selling items produced while preparing property, plant and equipment for
its intended use, and the related cost, in profit or loss, instead of deducting the amounts received from the cost of the

1 Diluted earnings attributable to BHP shareholders are equal to earnings attributable to BHP shareholders.
2 Prior to the unification of BHP’s corporate structure, the calculation of the number of ordinary shares used in the computation of basic earnings
per share was the aggregate of the weighted average number of ordinary shares of BHP Group Limited and BHP Group Plc outstanding during
the period after deduction of the number of shares held by the Billiton Employee Share Ownership Trust and the BHP Billiton Limited
Employee Equity Trust. Effective from 31 January 2022, the aggregate of the weighted average number of ordinary shares of only BHP Group
Limited is considered in the computation of basic earnings per share.
3 For the purposes of calculating diluted earnings per share, the effect of 9 million dilutive shares has been taken into account for the half year
ended 31 December 2022 (31 December 2021: 11 million shares; 30 June 2022: 10 million shares). The Group’s only potential dilutive
ordinary shares are share awards granted under employee share ownership plans. Diluted earnings per share calculation excludes
instruments which are considered antidilutive.
At 31 December 2022, there are no instruments which are considered antidilutive (31 December 2021: nil; 30 June 2022: nil).
4 Each American Depositary Share (ADS) represents twice the earnings for BHP Group Limited ordinary shares.

Dividends paid during the period differs from the amount of dividends paid in the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement as
a result of foreign exchange gains and losses relating to the timing of equity distributions between the record date and
the payment date. An additional derivative settlement of US$209 million was made as part of the funding of the final
dividend and is disclosed in ‘Proceeds of cash management related instruments’ in the Consolidated Cash Flow
Statement.
Each American Depositary Share represents two ordinary shares of BHP Group Limited. Dividends determined on each
ADS represent twice the dividend determined on BHP Group Limited ordinary shares.
Dividends are determined after period-end and contained within the announcement of the results for the period. Interim
dividends are determined in February and paid in March. Final dividends are determined in August and paid in
September. Dividends determined are not recorded as a liability at the end of the period to which they relate. Subsequent
to the half year, on 21 February 2023, BHP Group Limited determined an interim ordinary dividend of 90 US cents per
share (US$4,559 million), which will be paid on 30 March 2023 (31 December 2021: interim dividend of 150 US cents
per share – US$7,593 million; 30 June 2022: final dividend of 175 US cents per share – US$8,857 million).
BHP Group Limited dividends for all periods presented are, or will be, fully franked based on a tax rate of 30 per cent.

8. Financial risk management – Fair values
Recognition and measurement
All financial assets and financial liabilities, other than derivatives and trade receivables, are initially recognised at the
fair value of consideration paid or received, net of transaction costs as appropriate. Financial assets are initially
recognised on their trade date.
Financial assets are subsequently carried at fair value or amortised cost based on:
 the Group’s purpose, or business model, for holding the financial asset;
 whether the financial asset’s contractual terms give rise to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and
interest.
The resulting Financial Statements classifications of financial assets can be summarised as follows:
Contractual cash flows Business model Category
Solely principal and interest Hold in order to collect contractual cash flows Amortised cost
Solely principal and interest Hold in order to collect contractual cash flows and sell Fair value through other comprehensive income
Solely principal and interest Hold in order to sell Fair value through profit or loss
Other Any of those mentioned above Fair value through profit or loss
Solely principal and interest refers to the Group receiving returns only for the time value of money and the credit risk of
the counterparty for financial assets held. The main exceptions for the Group are provisionally priced receivables and
derivatives which are measured at fair value through the profit or loss under IFRS 9/AASB 9 ‘Financial Instruments’.
The Group has the intention of collecting payment directly from its customers in most cases, however the Group also
participates in receivables financing programs in respect of selected customers. Receivables in these portfolios which
are classified as ‘hold in order to sell’, are provisionally priced receivables and are therefore held at fair value through
profit or loss prior to sale to the financial institution.
With the exception of derivative contracts and provisionally priced trade payables which are carried at fair value through
profit or loss, the Group’s financial liabilities are classified as subsequently measured at amortised cost.
The Group may in addition elect to designate certain financial assets or liabilities at fair value through profit or loss or to
apply hedge accounting where they are not mandatorily held at fair value through profit or loss.
Fair value measurement
The carrying amount of financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value is principally calculated based on inputs
other than quoted prices that are observable for these financial assets or liabilities, either directly (i.e. as unquoted
prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices). Where no price information is available from a quoted market source,
alternative market mechanisms or recent comparable transactions, fair value is estimated based on the Group’s views
on relevant future prices, net of valuation allowances to accommodate liquidity, modelling and other risks implicit in such
estimates.
The inputs used in fair value calculations are determined by the Group’s relevant subject matter experts, who operate
under a defined set of accountabilities authorised by the Executive Leadership Team. Movements in the fair value of
financial assets and liabilities may be recognised through the income statement or in other comprehensive income
according to the designation of the underlying instrument.
For financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value, the Group uses the following to categorise the inputs to the
valuation method used based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole:
IFRS 13 Fair value
hierarchy Level 1 Level 2 Level 3
Valuation inputs Based on quoted prices
(unadjusted) in active
markets for identical
financial assets and
liabilities.
Based on inputs other than quoted prices
included within Level 1 that are observable
for the financial asset or liability, either
directly (i.e. as unquoted prices) or indirectly
(i.e. derived from prices).
Based on inputs not observable in
the market using appropriate
valuation models, including
discounted cash flow modelling.

The carrying amounts in the table above generally approximate to fair value. In the case of US$534 million (30 June
2022: US$3,018 million) of fixed rate debt not swapped to floating rate, the fair value at 31 December 2022 was US$548
million (30 June 2022: US$3,126 million). The fair value is determined using a method that can be categorised as Level
2 and uses inputs based on benchmark interest rates, alternative market mechanisms or recent comparable
transactions.
For financial instruments that are carried at fair value on a recurring basis, the Group determines whether transfers have
occurred between levels in the fair value hierarchy by reassessing categorisation at the end of each reporting period.
There were no transfers between categories during the period.
Interest Rate Benchmark Reform
The London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and other benchmark interest rates are being replaced by alternative riskfree rates (ARR) as part of inter-bank offer rate (IBOR) reform. Sterling LIBOR ceased to be published on 1 January
2022 and USD LIBOR will no longer be published after 30 June 2023.
Amendments to IFRS 9/AASB 9 ‘Financial Instruments’, IFRS 7/AASB 7 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’ and IFRS
16/AASB 16 ‘Leases’ in relation to IBOR reform early adopted by the Group in previous periods impact the Group’s
cross currency and interest rate swaps, which prior to IBOR reform referenced the US LIBOR benchmark, and the
associated hedge accounting.
These amendments provide relief from applying certain hedge accounting requirements to hedging arrangements
directly impacted by IBOR reform. In particular, where changes to the Group’s instruments arise solely as a result of
IBOR reform and do not change the economic substance of the Group’s arrangements, the Group is able to maintain
its existing hedge relationships and accounting.
During the half year ended 31 December 2022, the Group actively transitioned all impacted cross currency and interest
rate swaps from US LIBOR to the alternative, widely adopted Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) benchmark.
As the transition resulted solely from IBOR reform, the Group has applied the relief available in IFRS 9/AASB 9 ‘Financial
Instruments’ and continues to apply hedge accounting to its hedging arrangements, including accounting for
ineffectiveness.
The Group does not hold any material lease arrangements that contain reference to existing benchmarks and as a result
there is no material impact on lease liabilities or right-of-use assets at 31 December 2022.

Provision for Samarco dam failure
On 2 March 2016, BHP Brasil, Samarco and Vale, entered into a Framework Agreement with the Federal Government
of Brazil, the states of Espírito Santo and Minas Gerais and certain other public authorities to establish a foundation
(Fundação Renova) to develop and execute environmental and socio-economic programs (Programs) to remediate and
provide compensation for the damages caused by the Samarco dam failure (the Framework Agreement). Key Programs
include those for financial assistance and compensation of impacted persons, including fisherfolk impacted by the dam
failure, and those for remediation of impacted areas and resettlement of impacted communities. A committee (the
Interfederative Committee) comprising representatives from the Brazilian Federal and State Governments, local
municipalities, environmental agencies, impacted communities and Public Defence Office oversees the activities of the
Fundação Renova in order to monitor, guide and assess the progress of the actions agreed in the Framework
Agreement.
In addition, the Federal Court is supervising the work of the Fundação Renova and the Court’s decisions, including
decisions relating to the scope of individuals eligible for compensation and the amount of damages to which they are
entitled, have been considered in the Samarco dam failure provision change in estimate. Any future decisions will be
analysed for impacts on the provision at the time of any decision and the provision may be impacted in future reporting
periods as a result of appeals and motions for clarification on certain Court decisions that remain outstanding.
To the extent that Samarco does not meet its Renova funding obligations during the 15 year term of the Framework
Agreement, each of BHP Brasil and Vale have secondary funding obligations under the Framework Agreement in
proportion to its 50 per cent shareholding in Samarco.
Samarco began to gradually recommence operations in December 2020, however, there remains significant uncertainty
regarding Samarco’s future cash flow generation and the outcome of the Judicial Reorganisation (outlined below). In
light of these uncertainties and based on currently available information, BHP Brasil’s provision for its obligations under
the Framework Agreement Programs is US$3.1 billion before tax and after discounting at 31 December 2022 (30 June
2022: US$3.2 billion).
Under a Governance Agreement ratified on 8 August 2018, BHP Brasil, Samarco and Vale were to establish a process
to renegotiate the Programs over two years to progress settlement of the R$155 billion (approximately US$30 billion)
Federal Public Prosecution Office claim (described below). Pre-requisites established in the Governance Agreement,
for re-negotiation of the Framework Agreement were not implemented during the two year period and on 30 September
2020, Brazilian Federal and State prosecutors and public defenders filed a request for the immediate resumption of the
R$155 billion (approximately US$30 billion) claim, which was suspended from the date of ratification of the Governance

Agreement. The claim was suspended again after the parties to the claim agreed to continue the suspension on 19
March 2021. Formal suspension of the claim ceased on 10 December 2021, however no further material rulings have
been made.
BHP Brasil, Samarco, Vale and Federal and State prosecutors have been engaging in negotiations to seek a definitive
and substantive settlement of the obligations under the Framework Agreement and the R$155 billion (approximately
US$30 billion) Federal Public Prosecution Office claim. The negotiations are currently ongoing. Outcomes of the
negotiations are highly uncertain and, until any revisions to the Programs are agreed, Fundação Renova will continue
to implement the Programs in accordance with the terms of the Framework Agreement and the Governance Agreement.
BHP Brasil, Samarco and Vale maintain security, as required by the Governance Agreement, with the security currently
comprising insurance bonds and a charge over Samarco’s assets.
Samarco Germano dam decommissioning
Samarco is currently progressing plans for the accelerated decommissioning of its upstream tailings dams (the Germano
dam complex). Given the uncertainties surrounding Samarco’s long-term cash flow generation, BHP Brasil’s provision
for a 50 per cent share of the expected Germano decommissioning costs is US$164 million at 31 December 2022 (30
June 2022: US$184 million). While the decommissioning is progressing well, further engineering work may be necessary
and required validation by Brazilian authorities could lead to changes to estimates in future reporting periods.
Contingent liabilities
The following matters are disclosed as contingent liabilities and given the status of proceedings it is not possible to
provide a range of possible outcomes or a reliable estimate of potential future exposures for BHP, unless otherwise
stated. Ultimately, all the legal matters disclosed as contingent liabilities could have a material adverse impact on BHP’s
business, competitive position, cash flows, prospects, liquidity and shareholder returns.
Federal Public Prosecution Office claim
BHP Brasil is among the defendants named in a claim brought by the Federal Public Prosecution Office on 3 May 2016,
seeking R$155 billion (approximately US$30 billion) for reparation, compensation and moral damages in relation to the
Samarco dam failure.
The Federal Court previously suspended the Federal Public Prosecution Office claim, including a R$7.7 billion
(approximately US$1.5 billion) injunction request. On 30 September 2020, Brazilian Federal and State prosecutors and
public defenders filed a request for the immediate resumption of the R$155 billion (approximately US$30 billion) claim,
which was suspended from the date of ratification of the Governance Agreement. Formal suspension of the claim ceased
on 10 December 2021, however no further material rulings have been made.
BHP Brasil, Samarco, Vale and Federal and State prosecutors have been engaging in negotiations to seek a definitive
and substantive settlement of the obligations under the Framework Agreement and the R$155 billion (approximately
US$30 billion) Federal Public Prosecution Office claim. The negotiations are currently ongoing. Outcomes of the
negotiations are highly uncertain and it is therefore not possible to provide a range of outcomes or a reliable estimate
of potential outcomes and there is a risk that a negotiated outcome may be materially higher than amounts currently
reflected in the Samarco dam failure provision.
Australian class action complaints
BHP Group Ltd is named as a defendant in a shareholder class action filed in the Federal Court of Australia on behalf
of persons who acquired shares in BHP Group Ltd on the Australian Securities Exchange or shares in BHP Group Plc
on the London Stock Exchange and Johannesburg Stock Exchange in periods prior to the Samarco dam failure. The
amount of damages sought is unspecified.
United Kingdom group action complaint
BHP Group (UK) Ltd (former BHP Group Plc) and BHP Group Ltd were named as defendants in group action claims for
damages filed in the courts of England. These claims were filed on behalf of certain individuals, governments,
businesses and communities in Brazil allegedly impacted by the Samarco dam failure. The amount of damages sought
in these claims is unspecified. In August 2019, the BHP parties filed a preliminary application to strike out or stay this
action on jurisdictional and other procedural grounds. That application was successful before the High Court and the
action was dismissed. However, on 8 July 2022, the Court of Appeal reversed the dismissal decision and allowed the
BHP Results for the half year ended 31 December 2022
43
action to proceed in England. The BHP defendants have sought permission to appeal to the Supreme Court of the
United Kingdom and await a decision from the Supreme Court on their permission application.
On 2 December 2022, the BHP defendants filed their defence and a contribution claim against Vale. The contribution
claim contends that if BHP’s defence is not successful and they are ordered to pay damages to the claimants, Vale
should contribute to any amount payable.
Criminal charges
The Federal Prosecutors’ Office has filed criminal charges against BHP Brasil, Samarco and Vale and certain employees
and former employees of BHP Brasil (Affected Individuals) in the Federal Court of Ponte Nova, Minas Gerais. On 3
March 2017, BHP Brasil filed its preliminary defences. The Federal Court terminated the charges against eight of the
Affected Individuals. The Federal Prosecutors’ Office has appealed seven of those decisions with hearings of the
appeals still pending. BHP Brasil rejects outright the charges against the company and the Affected Individuals and is
defending itself from all charges while fully supporting each of the Affected Individuals in their defence of the charges.
Civil public action commenced by Associations concerning the use of Tanfloc for water treatment
The Vila Lenira Residents Association, State of Espirito Santo Rural Producers and Artisans Association, Colatina Velha
Neighbourhood Residents Association, and United for the Progress of Palmeiras Neighbourhood Association have filed
a lawsuit against Samarco, BHP Brasil and Vale and others, including the State of Minas Gerais, the State of Espirito
Santo and the Federal Government. The plaintiffs allege that the defendants carried out a clandestine study on the
citizens of the locations affected by the Fundão’s Dam Failure, using TANFLOC – a tannin-based flocculant/coagulant
– that is currently used for wastewater treatment applications. The plaintiffs claim that this product allegedly put the
population at risk due to its alleged experimental qualities.
The plaintiffs are seeking multiple kinds of relief – material damages, moral damages, loss of profits – and that the
defendants should pay for water supply in all locations where there is no water source other than the Doce River.
On 25 July 2022, Samarco, BHP Brasil and Vale presented their defences individually, as well as the State of Minas
Gerais, the State of Espirito Santo and the Federal Government. The Court’s decision is still pending.
Other claims
BHP Brasil is among the companies named as defendants in a number of legal proceedings initiated by individuals,
non-governmental organisations (NGOs), corporations and governmental entities in Brazilian Federal and State courts
following the Samarco dam failure. The other defendants include Vale, Samarco and Fundação Renova. The lawsuits
include claims for compensation, environmental remediation and violations of Brazilian environmental and other laws,
among other matters. The lawsuits seek various remedies including reparation costs, compensation to injured
individuals and families of the deceased, recovery of personal and property losses, moral damages and injunctive relief.
In addition, government inquiries and investigations relating to the Samarco dam failure have been commenced by
numerous agencies of the Brazilian government and are ongoing.
Additional lawsuits and government investigations relating to the Samarco dam failure could be brought against BHP
Brasil and possibly other BHP entities in Brazil or other jurisdictions.
BHP insurance
BHP has various third party general liability and directors and officers insurances for claims related to the Samarco dam
failure made directly against BHP Brasil or other BHP entities, their directors and officers, including class actions.
External insurers have been notified of the Samarco dam failure along with the third party claims and class actions
referred to above. Recoveries related to general liability insurance are now considered complete. As at 31 December
2022, an insurance receivable has not been recognised for any potential recoveries in respect of ongoing matters.
Commitments
Under the terms of the Samarco joint venture agreement, BHP Brasil does not have an existing obligation to fund
Samarco.
BHP has agreed to fund a total of up to US$915 million for the Fundação Renova programs during calendar year 2023.
Any additional requests for funding or future investment provided would be subject to a future decision by BHP,
accounted for at that time. To the extent that Samarco does not meet its Fundação funding obligations, each of BHP
Financial Report
44
Brasil and Vale has funding obligations under the Framework Agreement in proportion to its 50 per cent shareholding
in Samarco.
Samarco judicial reorganisation
Samarco filed for Judicial Reorganisation (JR) in April 2021, with the Commercial Courts of Belo Horizonte, State of
Minas Gerais, Brazil (JR Court), after multiple enforcement actions taken by certain financial creditors of Samarco which
threatened Samarco’s operations. The JR is an insolvency proceeding with a means for Samarco to seek to restructure
its financial debts and establish a sustainable financial position that allows Samarco to continue to rebuild its operations
and strengthen its ability to meet its Fundação Renova related funding obligations. Samarco’s operations have continued
during the JR proceeding.
According to the list of creditors filed with the JR Court by the Judicial Administrators (who are in charge of a first review
of the list of creditors filed by Samarco), Fundação Renova’s funding obligations undertaken by Samarco are not subject
to the JR, although some financial creditors of Samarco have objected to this position. Some of such creditors filed
challenges to the list of creditors filed by the Judicial Administrators, in order to, among other things, prevent Samarco
from funding Fundação Renova. In December 2021, the Federal Court granted BHP Brasil's request that Samarco be
able to fund Fundação Renova obligations, overturning a temporary injunction against such funding previously granted
by the State Court of Appeals of Minas Gerais (State Court) in October 2021. BHP Brasil also obtained a preliminary
injunction from the Superior Court of Justice supporting the jurisdiction of the Federal Court, and not the State Court, in
this specific matter. An appeal on the merits against this ruling by certain financial creditors is still to be ruled upon.
Samarco has, with the support of BHP Brasil and Vale, continued to meet its Fundação Renova funding obligations.
In April 2022, Samarco presented a restructure proposal for voting at a meeting of its creditors (GMC) under the JR
proceeding, which was rejected by certain of the Samarco financial creditors. Samarco, BHP Brasil and Vale
subsequently each filed objections with the JR Court against the voting process regarding the rejection of the Samarco
proposal. The Samarco financial creditors and Samarco’s employee unions then proposed alternative restructure
proposals, which remain subject to ongoing consideration, including a legality check from the Judicial Administrators
and the JR Court.
In August 2022, Samarco, BHP Brasil, Vale and certain financial creditors took part in a court sanctioned mediation
process, however an agreement was unable to be reached.
In October 2022, the JR Court issued a ruling that extended the so-called stay period until April 2023, which provides
Samarco with protection from enforcement actions by its creditors.
In November 2022, the JR Court issued rulings regarding various legal matters in the JR process. One ruling rejected
the claims by certain financial creditors and the State Prosecutors of Minas Gerais (MPMG) that the corporate veil of
Samarco should be pierced and that BHP Brasil and Vale should be held liable for the debts of Samarco that are subject
to the JR. The MPMG has appealed this JR Court ruling. The JR Court also held that BHP Brasil and Vale are unable
to vote their claims at a GMC and that employees unions and certain financial creditors are also unable to vote their
claims at a GMC in relation to the respective restructure plans that they each proposed. Certain financial creditors have
appealed this JR Court ruling. In addition, the JR Court dismissed certain motions filed by Samarco, BHP Brasil and
Vale and hence confirmed the outcome of the GMC held in April 2021; that the Samarco restructure proposal is rejected.
The parties are able to appeal these decisions to the State Court.
It is expected that there will be continuing litigation from financial creditors against Samarco and its shareholders over
the course of the JR proceeding, including with respect to the treatment of Samarco’s Fundação Renova-related
obligations and continued attempts to pierce Samarco’s corporate veil to hold BHP Brasil and Vale liable for Samarco’s
debts. The duration and outcome of the JR remains uncertain with the potential for protracted litigation and appeals
because, among other things, the Samarco JR is occurring under new and untested Brazilian bankruptcy legislation.
While the JR is not expected to affect Samarco’s obligation or commitment to make full redress for the 2015 Fundão
dam failure, and is not expected to impact Fundação Renova’s ability to undertake that remediation and compensation,
it is not possible to determine the outcomes of the JR or reliably estimate any impact that the reorganisation may have
for BHP Brasil, including its share of the Samarco dam failure provisions.

Key judgements and estimates
Judgements
The outcomes of litigation are inherently difficult to predict and significant judgement has been applied in assessing
the likely outcome of legal claims and determining which legal claims require recognition of a provision or disclosure
of a contingent liability. The facts and circumstances relating to these cases are regularly evaluated in determining
whether a provision for any specific claim is required.
Management has determined that a provision can only be recognised for obligations under the Framework Agreement
and Samarco Germano dam decommissioning as at 31 December 2022. It is not yet possible to provide a range of
possible outcomes or a reliable estimate of potential future exposures to BHP in connection to the contingent liabilities
noted above, given their status.
Estimates
The provision for the Samarco dam failure currently only reflects the Group’s estimate of the remaining costs to
complete Programs under the Framework Agreement and requires the use of significant judgements, estimates and
assumptions. Based on current estimates, it is expected that approximately 80 per cent of remaining costs for
Programs under the Framework Agreement will be incurred by December 2024.
While the provisions have been measured based on the latest information available as at 31 December 2022, changes
in facts and circumstances are likely in future reporting periods and may lead to revisions to these estimates. However,
it is currently not possible to determine what facts and circumstances may change, therefore revisions in future
reporting periods due to the key estimates and factors outlined below cannot be reliably measured.
The key estimates that may have a material impact upon the provisions in the next and future reporting periods include
the:
• number of people eligible for financial assistance and compensation and the corresponding amount of expected
compensation; and
• costs to complete key infrastructure programs.
The provision may also be affected by factors including but not limited to:
• potential changes in scope of work and funding amounts required under the Framework Agreement including the
impact of the decisions of the Interfederative Committee along with further technical analysis, community
participation required under the Governance Agreement and rulings made by the Federal Court;
• the outcome of ongoing negotiations with State and Federal Prosecutors, including review of Fundação Renova’s
Programs as provided in the Governance Agreement;
• actual costs incurred;
• resolution of uncertainty in respect of the nature and extent of Samarco’s long term cash generation;
• updates to discount and foreign exchange rates; and
• the outcomes of Samarco’s judicial reorganisation.
In addition, the provision may be impacted by decisions in, or resolution of, existing and potential legal claims in Brazil
and other jurisdictions, including the outcome of the United Kingdom group action complaint and the negotiations
seeking a definitive and substantive settlement of the obligations under the Framework Agreement and the R$155
billion (approximately US$30 billion) Federal Public Prosecution Office claim.
Outcomes of the negotiations are highly uncertain and it is therefore not possible to provide a reliable estimate of
potential outcomes.
Given these factors, future actual cash outflows may differ from the amounts currently provided and changes to any
of the key assumptions and estimates outlined above could result in a material impact to the provision in the next and
future reporting periods.

stakeholders, which could in each case, lead to litigation, regulatory investigation or enforcement action (including class
actions or actions arising from contractual, legacy or other liabilities associated with divested assets), or a loss of
stakeholder and/or investor confidence. There are no material changes in those risk factors for the first six months of
this financial year except to the extent described in the ‘Outlook’ section.
 Operational events: Risks associated with operational events in connection with our activities globally.
 Accessing key markets: Risks associated with market concentration and our ability to sell and deliver products into
existing and future key markets.
 Optimising growth and portfolio returns: Risks associated with our ability to position our asset portfolio to generate
returns and value for shareholders, including through acquisitions, mergers and divestments.
 Significant social or environmental impacts: Risks associated with significant impacts of our operations on and
contributions to communities and environments throughout the life cycle of our assets and across our value chain.
 Inadequate business resilience: Risks associated with unanticipated or unforeseeable adverse events and a failure
of planning and preparedness to respond to, manage and recover from adverse events (including potential physical
impacts of climate change).
 Low-carbon transition: Risks associated with the transition to a low-carbon economy.
 Adopting technologies and maintaining digital security: Risks associated with adopting and implementing new
technologies, and maintaining the effectiveness of our existing digital landscape (including cyber defences) across
our value chain.
 Ethical misconduct: Risks associated with actual or alleged deviation from societal or business expectations of ethical
behaviour (including breaches of laws or regulations) and wider or cumulative organisational cultural failings.

income, consolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated cash flow statement for the
half year ended on that date, notes comprising a summary of significant accounting policies and other
explanatory information, and the directors’ declaration.
Based on our review, which is not an audit, we have not become aware of any matter that makes us
believe that the half year financial report of the Group does not comply with the Corporations Act
2001, including:
a. Giving a true and fair view of the consolidated financial position of the Group as at 31 December
2022 and of its consolidated financial performance for the half year ended on that date; and
b. Complying with International Accounting Standard IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting as issued by
the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), Australian Accounting Standard AASB 134

Basis for conclusion
We conducted our review in accordance with Australian Auditing Standard on Review Engagements
ASRE 2410 Review of a Financial Report Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity (ASRE
2410). Our responsibilities are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the review of the
half-year financial report section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with
the auditor independence requirements of the Corporations Act 2001 and the ethical requirements of
the Accounting Professional and Ethical Standards Board’s APES 110 Code of Ethics for Professional
Accountants (including Independence Standards) (the Code) that are relevant to our audit of the
annual financial report in Australia. We have also fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in
accordance with the Code.
Directors’ responsibilities for the half year financial report
The directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of the half year financial report that
gives a true and fair view in accordance with International Accounting Standards as issued by the
IASB, Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Act 2001 and for such internal control
as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of the half year financial report that
gives a true and fair view and is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
Auditor’s responsibilities for the review of the half year financial report
Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the half year financial report based on our review.
ASRE 2410 requires us to conclude whether we have become aware of any matter that makes us
believe that the half year financial report is not in accordance with the Corporations Act 2001
including giving a true and fair view of the Group’s financial position as at 31 December 2022 and its
performance for the half year ended on that date, and complying with International Accounting
Standard IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting as issued by the IASB, Australian Accounting Standard

A review of a half year financial report consists of making enquiries, primarily of persons responsible
for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is
substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with Australian Auditing Standards
and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all
significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit
opinion.

Non-IFRS financial information
We use various non-IFRS financial information to reflect our underlying financial performance.
Non-IFRS financial information is not defined or specified under the requirements of IFRS, but is derived from the
Group’s Consolidated Financial Statements prepared in accordance with IFRS. The non-IFRS financial information and
the below reconciliations included in this document are unaudited. The non-IFRS financial information presented is
consistent with how management review financial performance of the Group with the Board and the investment
community.
The “Definition and calculation of non-IFRS financial information” section outlines why we believe non-IFRS financial
information is useful and the calculation methodology. We believe non-IFRS financial information provides useful
information, however should not be considered as an indication of, or as a substitute for, statutory measures as an
indicator of actual operating performance (such as profit or net operating cash flow) or any other measure of financial
performance or position presented in accordance with IFRS, or as a measure of a company’s profitability, liquidity or
financial position.
The following tables provide reconciliations between non-IFRS financial information and their nearest respective IFRS
measure.
Exceptional items
To improve the comparability of underlying financial performance between reporting periods, some of our non-IFRS
financial information adjusts the relevant IFRS measures for exceptional items. Refer to the Group’s Financial Report
for further information on exceptional items.
Exceptional items are those gains or losses where their nature, including the expected frequency of the events giving
rise to them, and impact is considered material to the Group’s Consolidated Financial Statements. The exceptional items

– Continuing
operations
Underlying attributable profit – Continuing
operations divided by the weighted basic
average number of shares.
Underlying
EBITDA
Used to help assess current operational profitability
excluding the impacts of sunk costs (i.e. depreciation
from initial investment). Each is a measure that
management uses internally to assess the
performance of the Group’s segments and make
decisions on the allocation of resources.
Earnings before net finance costs, depreciation,
amortisation and impairments, taxation expense,
Discontinued operations and exceptional items.
Underlying EBITDA includes BHP’s share of
profit/(loss) from investments accounted for
using the equity method including net finance
costs, depreciation, amortisation and
impairments and taxation expense/(benefit).
Underlying
EBITDA margin
Underlying EBITDA excluding third party product
EBITDA, divided by revenue excluding third
party product revenue.
Underlying EBIT Used to help assess current operational profitability
excluding net finance costs and taxation expense
(each of which are managed at the Group level) as
well as Discontinued operations and any exceptional
items.
Earnings before net finance costs, taxation
expense, Discontinued operations and any
exceptional items. Underlying EBIT includes
BHP’s share of profit/(loss) from investments
accounted for using the equity method including
net finance costs and taxation expense/(benefit).
Profit from
operations
Earnings before net finance costs, taxation
expense and Discontinued operations. Profit
from operations includes Revenue, Other
income, Expenses excluding net finance costs
and BHP’s share of profit/(loss) from
investments accounted for using the equity
method including net finance costs and taxation
expense/(benefit).
Capital and
exploration
expenditure
Used as part of our Capital Allocation Framework to
assess efficient deployment of capital. Represents the
total outflows of our operational investing expenditure.
Represents the total outflows of our operational
investing expenditure excluding the contribution of

Non-IFRS financial
information
Reasons why we believe the non-IFRS financial
information are useful
Calculation methodology
Free cash flow It is a key measure used as part of our Capital
Allocation Framework. Reflects our operational cash
performance inclusive of investment expenditure,
which helps to highlight how much cash was
generated in the period to be available for the
servicing of debt and distribution to shareholders.
Reflects our operational cash performance inclusive
of investment expenditure, but excluding the
contribution of Discontinued operations.
Net operating cash flows less net investing cash
flows.
Free cash flow –
Continuing
operations
Net operating cash flows from Continuing
operations less net investing cash flows from
Continuing operations.
Net debt Net debt shows the position of gross debt less indexlinked freight contracts offset by cash immediately
available to pay debt if required and any associated
derivative financial instruments. Liability associated
with index-linked freight contracts, which are required
to be remeasured to the prevailing freight index at
each reporting date, are excluded from the net debt
calculation due to the short-term volatility of the index
they relate to not aligning with how the Group uses
net debt for decision making in relation to the Capital
Allocation Framework. Net debt includes the fair value
of derivative financial instruments used to hedge cash
and borrowings to reflect the Group’s risk
management strategy of reducing the volatility of net
debt caused by fluctuations in foreign exchange and
interest rates.
Net debt, along with the gearing ratio, is used to
monitor the Group’s capital management by relating
net debt relative to equity from shareholders.
Interest bearing liabilities less liability associated
with index-linked freight contracts less cash and
cash equivalents less net cross currency and
interest rate swaps less net cash management
related instruments for the Group at the
reporting date.
Gearing ratio Ratio of Net debt to Net debt plus Net assets.
Net operating
assets
Enables a clearer view of the assets deployed to
generate earnings by highlighting the net operating
assets of the business separate from the financing
and tax balances. This measure helps provide an
indicator of the underlying performance of our assets
and enhances comparability between them.
Operating assets net of operating liabilities,
including the carrying value of equity accounted
investments and predominantly excludes cash
balances, loans to associates, interest bearing
liabilities, derivatives hedging our net debt,
assets held for sale, liabilities directly associated
with assets held for sale and tax balances.
Underlying return
on capital
employed (ROCE)
Indicator of the Group’s capital efficiency and is
provided on an underlying basis to allow
comparability of underlying financial performance by
excluding the impacts of exceptional items.
Profit after taxation excluding exceptional items
and net finance costs (after taxation) divided by
average capital employed.
Profit after taxation excluding exceptional items
and net finance costs (after taxation) is profit
after taxation from Continuing and Discontinued
operations excluding exceptional items, net
finance costs and the estimated taxation impact
of net finance costs. These are annualised for a
half year end reporting period.
The estimated tax impact is calculated using a
prima facie taxation rate on net finance costs
(excluding any foreign exchange impact).
Average capital employed is calculated as the
average of net assets less net debt for the last
two reporting periods.
Non-IFRS Financial Information
64
Non-IFRS financial
information
Reasons why we believe the non-IFRS financial
information are useful
Calculation methodology
Adjusted effective
tax rate
Provides an underlying tax basis to allow
comparability of underlying financial performance by
excluding the impacts of exceptional items.
Total taxation expense/(benefit) excluding
exceptional items and exchange rate
movements included in taxation
expense/(benefit) divided by Profit before
taxation from Continuing operations excluding
exceptional items.
Unit cost Used to assess the controllable financial performance
of the Group’s assets for each unit of production. Unit
costs are adjusted for site specific non controllable
factors to enhance comparability between the Group’s
assets.
Ratio of net costs of the assets to the equity
share of sales tonnage. Net costs is defined as
revenue less Underlying EBITDA and excludes
freight and other costs, depending on the nature
of each asset. Freight is excluded as the Group
believes it provides a similar basis of
comparison to our peer group.
Escondida unit costs exclude:
• by-product credits being the favourable
impact of by-products (such as gold or
silver) to determine the directly attributable
costs of copper production.
WAIO, BMA and NSWEC unit costs exclude:
• royalties as these are costs that are not
deemed to be under the Group's control,
and the Group believes exclusion provides
a similar basis of comparison to our peer
group.

Definition and calculation of principal factors
The method of calculation of the principal factors that affect the period on period movements of Revenue, Profit from
operations and Underlying EBITDA are as follows:
Principal factor Method of calculation
Change in sales prices Change in average realised price for each operation from the prior period to the current period,
multiplied by current period sales volumes.
Price-linked costs Change in price-linked costs (mainly royalties) for each operation from the prior period to the
current period, multiplied by current period sales volumes.
Change in volumes Change in sales volumes for each operation multiplied by the prior year average realised price
less variable unit cost.
Controllable cash costs Total of operating cash costs and exploration and business development costs.
Operating cash costs Change in total costs, other than price-linked costs, exchange rates, inflation on costs, fuel,
energy, and consumable price movements, non-cash costs and one-off items as defined below
for each operation from the prior period to the current period.
Exploration and business
development
Exploration and business development expense in the current period minus exploration and
business development expense in the prior period.
Exchange rates Change in exchange rate multiplied by current period local currency revenue and expenses.
Inflation on costs Change in inflation rate applied to expenses, other than depreciation and amortisation, pricelinked costs, exploration and business development expenses, expenses in ceased and sold
operations and expenses in new and acquired operations.
Fuel, energy, and
consumable price
movements

Definition and calculation of Key Indicator terms
We use various Key Indicators to reflect our sustainability performance.
Management uses these Key Indicators to evaluate BHP’s performance against both positive and negative impacts of
operational activities and our progress against our sustainability commitments and targets.
This section outlines why we believe the Key Indicators are useful to the Board, management, investors and other
stakeholders, and the methodology behind the metrics. A definition and explanation of each of the Key Indicators are
provided in the tables below.
Health and safety-related metrics
Our highest priority is the safety of our people and the communities in which we operate. This is why are focussed on
introducing more reliable and effective controls across our safety risk profile and improving human and organisational
performance, enabling our people to work safely each day. Our work in fatality elimination is underpinned by our field
leadership program, ensuring our leaders are spending quality time in field engaging with our workforce. The health and
safety Key Indicators allow the Board, management, investors and other stakeholders to measure and track health and
safety performance at our operated assets.
Key Indicator Calculation methodology
High Potential
Injury (HPI)
High potential injury frequency (HPIF) is an indicator which measures the number of injuries with fatal
potential per million hours. HPIF equals the sum of (lost time cases + restricted work cases + medical
treatment cases + first aid cases) x 1,000,000 ÷ total hours worked.
High potential injuries remain a primary focus to assess progress against our most important safety objective:
to eliminate fatalities.
The basis of calculation for high potential injuries was revised in FY2020 from event count to injury count as
part of a safety reporting methodology improvement. In some events, multiple people are injured.
This methodology has been prepared in accordance with GRI standard 403-9.
Total
Recordable
Injury
Frequency
(TRIF)
Total recordable injury frequency (TRIF) is an indicator which measures the number of recordable injuries per
million hours. TRIF equals the sum of (fatalities + lost-time cases + restricted work cases + medical treatment
cases) x 1,000,000 ÷ total hours worked total exposure hours. BHP adopts the US Government Occupational
Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) guidelines for the recording and reporting of occupational injury
and illnesses. TRIF statistics exclude non-operated assets.
Year-on-year improvement of TRIF is one of our five-year sustainability targets and is one of the indicators
used to assess our safety performance.
This methodology has been prepared in accordance with GRI standard 403-9 and OSHA guidelines.
Climate change-related metrics
Climate change-related risks are assessed to determine their potential impacts and likelihood, enable prioritisation and
determine risk treatment options. We then implement controls designed to prevent, minimise or mitigate threats, and
enable or enhance opportunities. Risks and controls are reviewed periodically and on an ad hoc basis to evaluate
performance. Climate-related risks can be grouped into two categories:
• Transition risks arise from policy, regulatory, legal, technological, market and other societal responses to the
challenges posed by climate change and the transition to a low-carbon economy and
• Physical risks refer to acute risks that are event-driven, including increased severity and frequency of extreme
weather events, and chronic risks resulting from longer-term changes in climate patterns.
Our climate change Key Indicators help us monitor our climate change commitments to mitigate the risks and
potential impacts associated with climate change to BHP, as well as fulfil our regulatory reporting obligations. The
Key Indicators allow the Board, management, investors and other stakeholders to measure BHP’s performance
against these commitments.

Key Indicator Calculation methodology
Operational
GHG
emissions
(Scopes 1 and
2)
Operational greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions include Scopes 1 and 2 emissions calculated based on an
operational control approach in accordance with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Accounting and
Reporting Standard.
Scope 1 refers to direct GHG emissions from operated assets. Scope 2 refers to indirect GHG emissions
from the generation of purchased or acquired electricity, steam, heat or cooling that is consumed by operated
assets.
Calculation methodology
Operational GHG emissions are calculated using activity data collected at our operated assets. Activity data
is multiplied by an energy content (where necessary) and emission factors to derive the energy consumption
and GHG emissions associated with a process or an operation. Examples of activity data include kilowatthours of electricity used or quantity of fuel used.
Scope 2 emissions are calculated using market-based reporting. Market-based reporting calculates Scope 2
emissions based on the generators (and therefore the generation fuel mix) from which the reporting company
contractually purchases electricity and/or is directly provided electricity via a direct line transfer.
More information on the calculation methodologies, boundaries assumptions, adjustments and key
references used in the preparation of our Scopes 1 and 2 emissions data can be found in our BHP Scope 1,
2 and 3 Emissions Calculation Methodology available at bhp.com/climate.
Value chain
GHG
emissions
(Scope 3)
Definition
Value chain greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, also known as Scope 3 emissions, refers to all other indirect
emissions (not included in Scope 2) that occur in BHP’s value chain. For BHP, these are primarily emissions
resulting from our customers use and processing of the commodities supplied by BHP, as well as upstream
emissions associated with the extraction, production and transportation of the goods, services, fuels and
energy we purchase for use at our operations, emissions resulting from the transportation and distribution of
our products, and operational emissions (on an equity basis) from our non-operated joint ventures.
Methodology
The Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard
categorises Scope 3 emissions into 15 distinct categories. Where relevant to BHP, we report Scope 3
emissions for our business according to these categories.
More information on the calculation methodologies, boundaries assumptions and key references used in the
preparation of our Scope 3 emissions data can be found in our BHP Scope 1, 2 and 3 Emissions Calculation
Methodology available at bhp.com/climate.
People-related metrics
Our global workforce is the foundation of our business and we believe that supporting the wellbeing of our people and
promoting an inclusive and diverse culture are vital for maintaining a competitive advantage. The proportion of the
workforce that are female or Indigenous workers are key indicators, which allow the Board, management, investors and
other stakeholders to measure and track our near and long-term progress.
Key Indicator Calculation methodology
Female
workforce
participation
(%)
The number of female employees as a proportion of the total workforce on the last day of the respective
reporting period, used in internal management reporting for the purposes of monitoring progress against our
goals.
Indigenous
workforce
participation
(%)
The number of Indigenous employees as a proportion of the total workforce in the relevant employee
population on the last day of the respective reporting period, used in internal management reporting for the
purposes of monitoring progress against our goals.
There is no significant seasonal variation in employment numbers.
These methodologies have been prepared in accordance with GRI standard 102-8 and GRI standard 405-1.

Project status update
Oak Dam is located 65 kilometres to the southeast of BHP’s operations at Olympic Dam in South Australia (Project
Area, Figure 1). Since commencing Phase 4 drilling at Oak Dam in May 2021, approximately 40 km of new drilling has
been completed to the end of December 2022.
Total drilling at Oak Dam is approximately 78 km, with nominal drill space ranging from 80 m to >200 m, perpendicular
to the interpreted orebody orientation. Figure 2 describes the location of the new drilling and Figure 3 shows the new
drilling on cross section. Drilling collar location is provided in Table 1, and intercepts of copper, with associated gold,
uranium and silver, are provided in Table 2.
This release reflects progress in our exploration activities. Further work will be required to enable an estimate of Mineral
Resources.
Geology and mineralisation
The mineralisation system at Oak Dam sits within in a granitic basement, below an unconformable contact with a post
mineral cover. Thickness of cover ranges from 700 m to >900 m from surface.
Mineralisation at Oak Dam is typical of iron oxide copper gold (IOCG) style alteration and sulphide mineralisation, with
higher-grade chalcocite and bornite mineralisation surrounding a core of barren hematite-quartz breccias. Mineralisation
decreases outwards of this contact to chalcopyrite and pyrite dominant sulphides. A simplified geology basement plan
is provided in Figure 2, and a representative cross-section in Figure 3.

Section 1 Sampling Techniques and Data
Sampling techniques
 All drilling was oriented diamond drilling from surface.
 Diamond core was sampled at 1 m or 2 m intervals. 1 m samples were taken in mineralised or unmineralised but
altered formations. 2 m interval sampling was undertaken where drilling intersected unaltered formations. The
sampling, assay and quality control methodologies is the same for all sample intervals.
Drilling techniques
 Parent holes were collared in HWT diameter (101.6 mm) to a depth of 6 m and continued in PQ (85 mm) until the
Tregolana Shale unit in the post mineral cover. From the Tregolana Shale, drilling continued in HQ (63.5 mm) to the
depth chosen to begin navigational drilling. Navigational drilling was completed on the parent hole and subsequent
wedges.
 All drilling below the post mineral cover was completed in NQ2 diameter (75.7 mm).
 All down hole surveys used a north-seeking gyroscope to end of hole.
Drill sample recovery
 Sample recoveries were visually estimated to be >97%.
 Sample loss was not considered material to reported grades.
Logging
 Drill holes were logged in qualitative detail below the post mineral cover.
 Logging included, but was not limited to, lithology composition and texture, alteration minerals, sulphide distribution
and geotechnical logging for rock-mass qualification.
 Structural measurements were recorded from oriented core.
 Core was photographed both wet and dry.
Sub-sampling techniques and sample preparation
 Diamond core was split by core saw, with half core submitted for assay and the other half stored in trays at Olympic
Dam. Samples are submitted as 1 m intervals.
 Approximately 4-8 kg samples were submitted to an analytical laboratory for final drying, staged crushing to 2 mm,
splitting to approximately 2-3 kg portion, followed by pulverisation to 90% passing 75 micron particle size pulp.
 Duplicate samples were collected at each preparation stage where a reduction in sample mass occurred.
 Bulk dry density measurements were collected on all assayed samples using water immersion method.
Quality of assay data and laboratory tests
 All samples were submitted to Intertek Group Plc, Adelaide Laboratory, South Australia.
 Drill hole results reported here were analysed for an expanded multi-element suite including Cu (4-acid digest,
measured by ICP-OES), Ag (4-acid digest, measured by ICP-MS), U (lithium borate fusion, measured by ICP-MS),
Au (25 g fire assay, measured by ICP-OES) and S (induction furnace combustion, measured by infrared analyser).
 Quality control samples consisted of duplicates (1:25), analytical blanks (1:50) and certified standards (1:25).
 Quality control results were reviewed when received, all performed within acceptable accuracy and precision limits.
Appendix 1: Explanatory Notes and JORC Table 1
76
Verification of sampling and assaying
 BHP has robust QAQC standards and procedures relating to sampling and assay quality control.
 There were no adjustments to the assay data. Data is electronically uploaded to the database from the external
laboratory.
 All drill hole data is managed internally via a SQL server hosted database with strict validation rules.
 No twinned holes have been drilled.
Location of data points
 All drill hole collar locations (historic and recent) have been surveyed with Trimble R8s and manually entered into
acQuire database.
 All coordinates are provided in Geocentric Datum of Australia 1994 (GDA94 Zone 53).
Data spacing and distribution
 Drilling from surface used parent and wedge-styled drilling.
 Nominal drill space ranging from 80 m to >200 m.
 Drilling is perpendicular to the interpreted orebody orientation.
Orientation of data in relation to geological structure
 Drilling at Oak Dam is designed to intersect mineralisation nominally perpendicular to the strike.
 Drill holes were angled approximately northwest-southeast to east-west, and were designed to drill from outside the
hydrothermal system, inwards towards mineralisation and their contract with the barren hematite-quartz breccias.
Drilling was designed to test the eastern and western contacts with the host rock.
Sample security
 Core trays are transported by BHP contractors from the Oak Dam project to the core processing facility at Olympic
Dam, Roxby Downs. Samples in calico bags are transported from Olympic Dam via road on trucks to Intertek
laboratory, Adelaide.
 Calico bag numbers are automatically generated. Intertek is informed of the sample number ranges for each pending
shipment and are recorded in their management system. Intertek use these to create barcode labels for Kraft
geochemical bags used for storing the pulverised samples. On sample receipt, Intertek manually checks the
submitted sample list against all samples in the shipment. Once the samples are pulverised, all further steps are
tracked using the bar codes. BHP is informed of any discrepancies.
 BHP has internal governance and standards related to sample security and data management. BHP undertakes
routine verification of these practices.
Audits or reviews

Section 2 Reporting of Exploration Results
Mineral tenement and land tenure status
 The project is located within Exploration Licence 5941 (EL5941), which is 100% owned by BHP.
 A renewal application for EL5941 has been submitted to South Australian Department for Energy and Mining (DEM).
Upon approval, the new expiry date for EL5941 will be 22 February 2028.
 EL5941 is in ‘good standing’ with minimum expenditure met and exceeded.
 BHP has reasonable expectation that EL5941 will be renewed.
Exploration done by other parties
 The project has a long exploration history, dating back to 1976 by Western Mining Corporation (prior to their
acquisition by BHP) and BHP.
Geology
 Refer to Geology and mineralisation section.
Drill hole information
 Table 1 and Table 2 provide details of drill hole coordinates, orientations and length for all drilling.
Data aggregation methods
 All reported intersections are length and density weighted with reported intersection in Table 2
 Intervals not included in Table 2 have less than 0.8% Cu. Reported mineralised intervals contain no more than ten
consecutive metres of <0.8% Cu
Relationship between mineralisation widths and intercept lengths
 Intersections are presented as apparent (downhole) widths, as true widths of intersections are unknown.
Diagrams
 Figures 1, 2 and 3 provide details of drill hole location and context.
Balanced reporting
 All exploration results from the period noted have been included.
Other substantive exploration data
 A single representative magnetic susceptibility measurement is recorded at 1m intervals within mineralisation.
 Pseudo 3D seismic data acquisition was undertaken in late 2022, processing and interpretation is in progress.
Further work
 BHP plans to continue drilling and engage externally with key stakeholders including Traditional Owners,
Landholders, Government and the Community, with a view to converting EL5941 to a Retention Lease.
